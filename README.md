Project in Godot 4.4 by Carson G

Most of my old ideas for mechanics didn't really work, so I am restructuring this to build a new system.  Old files can be found in a new branch,

The idea is essentially to create a set of generic systems that can be used to create just about any simple top-down rpg game I would want to create.

I am currently developing at "test level" using the numerous interconnected systems.  
As I develop this level, the core systems of the "engine" will start to develop. 
I will try to make the systems as generic and scalable as possible, however sacrifices will end up being made out of nessecity or occasional ignorance (this is my first big project in Godot)

Besides some code comments, there is little documentation.  Hopefully I will be able to work on this in the future.
